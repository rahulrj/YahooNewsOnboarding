# YahooNewsOnboarding
    
## Overview
This demo emulates the cool animations that be seen in the on-boarding screens of [Yahoo News Digest App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.atom).Yahoo News Digest
is a perfect example of some very good UI and the animations spread throughout the app further supplements this.
Among those, i tried my hands on the on-boarding animtions which looked the coolest.
